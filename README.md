# Quick Summary
 Run simulations of simple beams

 There is a description of the language inside the file "ReadMe.pdf"

 This language uses textx.
 The grammar for the language is defined in the file "Beam.tx"
 The interpreter is in "Beam.py"

# *Beam* Programming Language:
The *Beam* programming language is aimed at structural engineers who commonly work with beams. *Beam* allows engineers to define a beamâ€™s loading conditions to quickly run calculations to find commonly needed values such as support reaction forces and internal shear and bending moment.

At its current stage of development, *Beam* offers support for:
1.	Cantilever Beams
2.	Point loads at any angle
3.	Rectangular Distributed Loads
4.	Point Torques
5.	Finding Resultant Forces
6.	Finding Reaction Forces

<br />

## Sample Programs:

The following beam will be represented in *Beam*.

This sample program is for a cantilever beam with a 10kg point load at a location 10 meters from its support.

It outputs the following:

### Here is another sample program:
The following beam will be represented in *Beam*.

This program is for a cantilever beam with a rectangular distributed load that starts at a distance 5 meters from the support and continues for another 5 meters. The load has a magnitude of 2 Newtons per meter (N/m) in the negative y direction.

It outputs the following:

### Complex Sample Program:

The following complexly loaded beam will be represented in *Beam*.
